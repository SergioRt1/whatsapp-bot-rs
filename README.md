# A bot for WhatsApp in Rust

## Description

This project uses selenium through the [thirtyfour](https://docs.rs/thirtyfour/latest/thirtyfour/) library to interact
with the Chrome browser and simulate the interaction of a user to send an automated message to a WhatsApp chat.

To manage the WebDriver, we use [selenium-manager](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/tree/trunk/rust), which is a
standalone tool that automatically manages the browser infrastructure required by Selenium. It is implemented as a CLI (
Command-Line Interface) tool in Rust, so we import it as a library and use its internal functions to automate the
management of the WebDriver.
